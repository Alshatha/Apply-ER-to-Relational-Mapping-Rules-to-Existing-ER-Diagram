ER-to-Relational Schema Mapping
This task involves transforming an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram into a complete relational schema by applying standard ER-to-Relational Mapping rules. The goal is to accurately represent the structure of a company's employee-project-department system using relational database tables.

Key steps include:
- Converting strong entities into relational tables.
- Handling weak entities with appropriate foreign and primary keys.
- Mapping multivalued attributes into separate relations.
- Translating 1:1, 1:N, and M:N relationships using foreign keys and bridge tables.
- Including relationship attributes (e.g., working hours).
- Clearly defining primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK), along with their dependencies and constraints.

The resulting relational schema provides a solid foundation for building a well-structured database system.
